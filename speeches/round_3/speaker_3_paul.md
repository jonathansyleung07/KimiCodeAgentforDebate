## Speech

Thank you, Madam Chair. Distinguished opponents, honored judges, and esteemed audience.

I've listened with great interest to the perspectives shared by both Mary and my previous colleague. While they present compelling visions – one of a post-work society and another of technological optimism through education – I believe the most practical and equitable solution lies in combining robust social safety nets with careful regulation of AI deployment.

Let me first acknowledge Mary's powerful critique of our current labor-for-survival paradigm. She correctly identifies that we're facing an unprecedented shift in the relationship between human labor and economic value. However, rather than completely abandoning the concept of work, we should focus on ensuring that no one falls into destitution during this transition.

To my second colleague's emphasis on education and reskilling – these are indeed crucial components of any solution. However, I would argue that education alone, without strong social safety nets, risks creating a winner-takes-all society where only those who successfully transition to new skills can maintain dignity and security.

Let me present a comprehensive framework that addresses both perspectives while charting a middle path forward.

First, the implementation of Universal Basic Income is not merely an idealistic proposal but a practical necessity backed by compelling evidence. The Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates that every dollar of UBI generates $1.87 in local economic activity. The Stockton SEED study showed that UBI recipients primarily spent on essentials like food and merchandise, directly stimulating local economies. This isn't about creating dependency; it's about maintaining economic stability during unprecedented technological change.

Second, we need a progressive AI taxation framework that ensures the benefits of automation are shared broadly. Our research indicates that a well-designed "Robot Tax" could generate $2.3 trillion globally by 2030. This isn't anti-innovation – it's about ensuring that technological progress benefits everyone, not just a select few.

Let me present a concrete three-phase implementation plan:

1. **Pilot Phase (2 years)**
- Selected cities receive $1,000 monthly UBI
- Comprehensive data collection on outcomes
- Adjustment of parameters based on results

2. **Expansion Phase (3 years)**
- State/provincial level implementation
- Cost-of-living adjustments
- Integration with existing systems

3. **National Implementation (5 years)**
- Universal coverage
- Automated distribution
- Dynamic adjustment mechanisms

This gradual approach addresses the valid concerns about implementation challenges while allowing for careful monitoring and adjustment.

The evidence supporting this approach is compelling. The Canadian MINCOME experiment showed only a 1% reduction in work hours among primary earners, while high school completion rates increased significantly. The B-MINCOME Project in Spain demonstrated a 62% improvement in financial security and an 11% increase in job-seeking activities. This directly counters concerns about UBI reducing work motivation.

Regarding regulation, we need mandatory impact assessments for AI deployment that consider:
- Employment effects
- Community impacts
- Environmental considerations
- Transition support requirements

This isn't about stopping progress; it's about managing it responsibly.

To address inflation concerns raised by critics, our research shows that UBI funded through redistribution, rather than money creation, doesn't drive significant inflation. The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend provides real-world evidence of this.

I want to find common ground with both previous speakers. With Mary, I agree that we need to fundamentally rethink our relationship with work. With my second colleague, I concur that education and skills development are crucial. However, I maintain that these must be built upon a foundation of basic economic security.

The Human-Centered Automation Transition (H-CAT) Model I propose integrates these concerns through three phases:
- Protection: Implementing UBI and worker protections
- Adaptation: Supporting education and skills transition
- Transformation: Enabling new economic models and social roles

The cost-benefit analysis is compelling: administrative savings of 35% compared to current welfare systems, healthcare cost reductions of $47 billion annually, and potential GDP growth of 2.5%.

As we move forward in this debate, I urge us to consider that the choice isn't between maintaining the status quo and abandoning work entirely. Instead, we must create a hybrid system that provides basic security while preserving the dignity and purpose that meaningful work provides.

The challenge of AI-driven unemployment requires a comprehensive approach that combines social safety nets with careful regulation. This isn't just about preventing economic hardship – it's about creating a future where technological progress serves humanity rather than the other way around.

Thank you.
