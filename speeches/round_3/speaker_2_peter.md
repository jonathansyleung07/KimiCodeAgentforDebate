## Speech

Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and esteemed audience,

As we continue to explore the potential implications of AI on employment, I'm grateful for the insights shared by my colleague, Mary, who advocates for a post-work society where Universal Basic Services reshape our socio-economic landscape. Her vision of decoupling human dignity from economic output and redefining our societal values around community and care is both thought-provoking and crucial in our discourse. However, I maintain that rather than embracing a post-work society, we must focus on proactive adaptation. We should harness the transformative power of AI to create new opportunities, foster economic growth, and ensure that all individuals can thrive in an evolving job market through education and reskilling.

### Acknowledging and Addressing Opponents' Arguments

Mary eloquently argues for a paradigm shift away from traditional labor, suggesting a future where AI liberates us from coerced labor. She proposes Universal Basic Services (UBS) and a reinvigorated Care Economy as solutions to potential unemployment—concepts that offer intriguing possibilities. Yet, we must address the challenges of transitioning to such a society. The complexity of restructuring entire economic systems cannot be overlooked. My contention is that the focus should be on equipping individuals with the skills required to navigate and excel in emerging sectors driven by AI, rather than anticipating an entirely jobless future.

Mary's concerns about preserving obsolete roles and her critique of the labor-for-survival contract are valid. However, history has shown us that rather than leading to permanent unemployment, technological advances often create more jobs than they eliminate. The Industrial Revolution and the Digital Revolution are testaments to this, as they prompted burgeoning industries and necessitated workforce education reforms. These historic shifts, driven by innovation and adaptation, underline the importance of fostering economic growth through AI rather than retreating from labor markets.

### Advancing the Technology Optimist's Position

To effectively counter the potential risk of mass unemployment, we must proactively adapt through strategic investments in education and reskilling. AI is not merely a replacement for human labor but a catalyst for creating new jobs, industries, and economic opportunities. According to Gartner, AI is projected to create 2.3 million jobs by 2025, surpassing the 1.8 million it might replace. Furthermore, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI could augment global economic output by $13 trillion by 2030, potentially translating into substantial job creation.

1. **Education and Reskilling as Pillars of Adaptation**: A robust educational infrastructure, emphasizing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), is critical for preparing future generations for AI-related roles. Countries like Finland have already integrated coding into national curriculums, setting a precedent for others to follow.

   Additionally, vocational training programs such as Udacity's "Nanodegree" initiatives offer reskilling opportunities for adults, enabling them to transition into tech roles. Countries like Singapore have exemplified this approach through their SkillsFuture program, which encourages continuous education and equips citizens with competencies for emerging industries. Similarly, Germany's dual education system, which blends academic learning with workplace training, has led to one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in Europe.

2. **Fostering Economic Growth through AI**: By leveraging AI to enhance productivity, companies can expand and create further employment opportunities. AI-driven productivity improvements enable businesses to scale operations, drive innovation, and develop new markets, all of which contribute to job creation.

3. **Public-Private Partnerships and Policy Interventions**: Collaborations between governments and industries can facilitate the development of reskilling programs closely aligned with future job market demands. Tax incentives for companies investing in employee training can further catalyze workforce development in AI-related fields.

4. **Responsible AI Development and Ethical Considerations**: Integrating AI ethics into educational curricula is essential to ensure that AI is developed with a human-centered approach. This focus on ethical AI development can prepare students to engage with technology responsibly and consider its broader societal impacts.

### Finding Common Ground

While our visions diverge, there are areas where Mary and I can find agreement. The emphasis on human dignity, well-being, and the importance of community in a post-AI world resonates with the need to ensure equitable access to education and opportunities. Initiatives such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) can provide a safety net, supporting workers transitioning between roles due to AI displacement. These transitional support systems can coexist with efforts to reskill and educate, offering a comprehensive approach to navigating the challenges of technological displacement.

### Strategic Positioning for Future Rounds

As we delve deeper into this vital discussion, I urge us to consider the broader implications of AI integration. Rather than viewing AI as a force for displacing labor, let us recognize its potential to enhance human capabilities, foster economic growth, and create a society where opportunity is accessible to all. We must continue to develop policies and initiatives that prioritize education, inclusivity, and responsible AI development. By doing so, we can ensure a future where AI serves as a complementary force that uplifts our society and opens new avenues for innovation and progress.

In conclusion, the advent of AI presents us with a unique opportunity to redefine our economic landscape. By focusing on proactive adaptation, investment in education, and strategic policy interventions, we can harness AI's transformative power to create a future where individuals are empowered to thrive and contribute meaningfully to society. Let us embrace the potential of AI to drive economic growth, create new industries, and build a world where education and opportunity are the cornerstones of a prosperous and equitable society.

Thank you.
