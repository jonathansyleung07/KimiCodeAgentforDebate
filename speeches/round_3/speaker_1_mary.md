Honorable judges, opponents, and members of the audience.

The question before us today is: "How do we solve the potential problem of mass unemployment in the post-AI era?"

I posit that this question, while well-intentioned, is fundamentally flawed. It frames the liberation of humanity from coerced labor as a "problem" to be solved, rather than an unprecedented opportunity to be seized. If we view the end of the traditional job market through the lens of 20th-century capitalism, yes, it looks like a catastrophe. But if we view it through the lens of human history and potential, it is the moment we have been waiting for since the first tool was struck from stone.

My stance is clear: We must not try to "solve" unemployment by inventing busy-work or desperately clinging to an obsolete labor-for-survival contract. Instead, we must embrace a **Post-Work Society**. We must decouple human dignity from economic output and restructure our civilization around community, care, and intrinsic value.

### The Obsolescence of the "Labor-for-Survival" Contract

Let us begin by acknowledging the reality of our technological trajectory. We are facing what researchers call a "Capability Overhang." AI is no longer merely automating the dangerous, dirty, and dull jobs; it is automating cognitive tasks, creative analysis, and middle management. The "Productivity-Wage Gap" that has widened since the 1970s is about to become a chasm.

For centuries, our social contract has been simple: you work, and in exchange, you receive the right to survive. But what happens when the marginal cost of labor drops to zero? What happens when software can produce abundance without human sweat?

To insist on maintaining "jobs" in this environment is irrational. Consider this analogy: We did not complain when washing machines took our "laundry jobs." We did not lament the loss of 15 hours a week scrubbing clothes on a washboard. We celebrated it as liberation. Why, then, do we panic when AI threatens to take our spreadsheet jobs or our data entry jobs? The problem isn't the machine; the problem is that our society still requires us to "do laundry"—metaphorically speaking—to justify our right to eat.

We are currently suffering from a "Burnout Epidemic" and a proliferation of what the anthropologist David Graeber called "Bullshit Jobs"—roles that even those holding them admit are pointless. Trying to preserve these roles in the face of AI efficiency is not economic stability; it is a moral failure.

### The Solution: Universal Basic Services and the Care Economy

So, how do we structure a society where work is optional? We must move from an economy of extraction to an economy of care and distribution.

First, we must implement **Universal Basic Services (UBS)**. While many discuss Universal Basic Income (cash), UBS is far more resilient. In a post-work era, the essentials of life—housing, transport, high-speed internet, healthcare, and nutrition—must be free at the point of use. This is the bedrock of liberty. If your survival is guaranteed, your labor becomes a choice, not a frantic necessity.

How do we pay for this? We must reject the scarcity mindset. In a world of automated abundance, we should lean into **Technological Deflation**. If robots and algorithms drive the cost of production toward zero, the cost of living should also fall toward zero. Furthermore, we must implement a **Robot Tax** and **Data Dividends**. AI models are trained on *our* collective intelligence—our art, our code, our history. We are not "unemployed workers"; we are shareholders of this collective digital intelligence. A portion of every dollar of value generated by AI belongs to the public domain.

Second, we must revitalize the **Care Economy**. AI may write code, but it cannot hold the hand of a dying elder with genuine empathy. It cannot mentor a troubled youth with shared human experience. It cannot build a community garden that fosters local connection.

This is where the "work" of the future lies. By funding a "Care Corps"—paying people to care for their neighbors, their environment, and their communities—we shift value from generating profit for shareholders to generating well-being for citizens. This is not unemployment; this is the re-centering of human purpose.

### Debunking the Myth of Laziness

Now, I anticipate the primary counter-argument from my pragmatic opponents: "Without the threat of starvation, people will become lazy. Society will stagnate."

This is a cynical view of human nature that is not supported by evidence.

Look at the **Mincome Experiment** in Manitoba, Canada. When an entire town was given a guaranteed income, the workforce did not collapse. Only two groups worked significantly less: new mothers, who spent more time caring for their infants, and teenagers, who stayed in school longer to graduate. Hospitalization rates dropped by 8.5%.

Look at the **Stockton SEED Trial** in California. People receiving guaranteed income were actually *twice* as likely to find full-time employment than the control group. Why? Because having a financial floor gave them the mental bandwidth and risk tolerance to find meaningful work, rather than being trapped in the precarious survival mode of the gig economy.

Humans have an innate drive for **Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness**, as outlined in Self-Determination Theory. The aristocracy of the 18th and 19th centuries did not have "jobs," yet they gave us the Enlightenment, the scientific method, and great literature. They had the time to think, experiment, and create.

Our goal should be **"Aristocracy for All."** We are not moving toward a world of idleness, but toward a world where every human being has the freedom of an aristocrat to pursue their highest calling—whether that is astrophysics, poetry, gardening, or raising a family.

### Addressing the Transition and the Risks

I am not naive to the risks. The transition will be volatile. If we allow AI to be monopolized by a few tech oligarchs while the masses are left destitute, we will see social collapse. This is why **Democratic Ownership** of AI infrastructure is non-negotiable. We must treat AI compute power like a public utility, similar to electricity or water.

We must also prepare for a crisis of identity. For too long, we have asked our children, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" implying a job title. We must start asking, "What kind of person do you want to be?" We need a cultural shift that valorizes civic virtue, mentorship, and creativity over career climbing. We must rebuild our "Third Places"—our parks, libraries, and community centers—to replace the office as the primary site of social connection.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the "solution" to mass unemployment is not to fight against the tide of history to save the 40-hour workweek. That model was an invention of the industrial age, and it is ending.

The economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that by 2030, we would work 15-hour weeks. We missed that target because we chose consumerism over leisure. Let us not make that mistake again.

We have the technology to feed, house, and clothe every person on this planet with a fraction of the current human labor. To force people to work for survival in such a world is an act of cruelty.

Let us embrace the post-work society. Let us tax the machines to liberate the people. Let us define human value not by what we produce, but by how we care for one another. The end of work is not the end of the world; it is the beginning of our humanity.

Thank you.
