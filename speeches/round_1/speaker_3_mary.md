## Speech

Madam Chair, fellow delegates, and respected audience,

We are gathered here to answer a question that frames our collective anxiety: "How do we solve the potential problem of mass unemployment?"

I submit to you that we are asking the wrong question.

My esteemed opponent, the first speaker, argues that we must race to create new jobs to replace the old ones, citing a cycle of "creative destruction" that has served us since the Industrial Revolution. My second opponent, while more cautious, proposes a safety net of Universal Basic Income (UBI) and retraining to help workers survive this transition until they can find their place in the new economic machine.

Both arguments rest on a dangerous, outdated assumption: that human dignity is inextricably tied to wage labor, and that the ultimate goal of a technological civilization is to keep everyone employed 40 hours a week, forever.

I stand before you as a social critic to argue that mass unemployment is not a problem to be solved, but a liberation to be managed. The crisis we face is not a lack of work; it is a crisis of imagination. We are standing at the threshold of a post-work society, yet we are trying to drag the chains of 20th-century industrial capitalism with us.

**The Illusion of Endless Job Creation**

To the first speaker, who optimistically cites Gartner’s prediction of 2.3 million new jobs: we must ask, *what kind of jobs?*

Anthropologist David Graeber identified a phenomenon he called "Bullshit Jobs"—roles that exist primarily to keep people busy, manage bureaucracy, or stroke the egos of superiors, contributing nothing of real value to society. If AI eliminates the need for millions of accountants, paralegals, and coders, and we respond by inventing millions of new administrative hurdles just to keep people "employed," we are not creating an economy; we are creating a daycare for adults.

We did not complain when washing machines "took the jobs" of those scrubbing clothes by hand. We celebrated the return of time. Why, then, when AI offers to lift the burden of cognitive drudgery, do we panic? It is because we have built a society where the right to eat, the right to shelter, and the right to healthcare are held hostage by one’s ability to sell their labor.

**Beyond Safety Nets: The Foundation of Universal Basic Services**

I commend the second speaker for introducing the necessity of Universal Basic Income. The evidence from the Mincome experiment in Canada and the Stockton trials in California is irrefutable: when people are given guaranteed income, they do not become lazy. Hospitalization rates drop by 8.5%. Mental health improves. Teenagers stay in school longer.

However, a cash payment alone is a fragile shield against the storm of hyper-capitalism. If we have UBI but housing costs skyrocket, the money is worthless. Therefore, we must expand the conversation from Universal Basic Income to **Universal Basic Services (UBS)**.

In a post-AI world, where automation drives the marginal cost of production toward zero, the essentials of life—transportation, high-speed internet, education, and healthcare—should be demonetized. They must become public rights, not market commodities. This is the only way to break the link between labor and survival.

**Redefining Work: The Care Economy and the Commons**

Both my opponents speak of "reskilling," implying that the displaced truck driver must become a data analyst. But why?

We are entering an era of "Capability Overhang," where AI will eventually outperform humans in almost all technical and analytical tasks. The one domain where humans retain a monopoly is *humanity itself*. Empathy, community building, caregiving, and artistic creation.

Currently, our economy wildly undervalues the "Care Economy"—raising children, caring for the elderly, stewardship of our neighborhoods. This is work, but it is rarely "employment." In a post-work society supported by automation taxes—what we might call a "Robot Dividend"—we can finally value this labor.

Imagine a society where "full employment" isn't defined by corporate payrolls, but by community engagement. A society where the "job" of a citizen is to mentor the youth, to maintain the local park, to create art, or simply to be a present parent. This is not idleness; this is the democratization of the aristocracy. Throughout history, the greatest contributions to philosophy, science, and the arts came from those who had the leisure time to think. We now have the technology to grant that leisure to everyone, not just the wealthy elite.

**The Ecological Imperative**

Furthermore, there is an urgent ecological argument for the post-work society. The first speaker’s model of endless economic growth and job creation requires endless consumption. To keep people employed, we must convince them to buy things they don't need, produced by processes that destroy our biosphere.

A shift to a post-work society is a shift toward "degrowth" and sustainability. By reducing the work week—perhaps to the 15 hours John Maynard Keynes predicted in 1930—we drastically reduce carbon emissions from commuting and office energy use. We move from a culture of accumulation to a culture of time-affluence. We save the planet by simply ... slowing down.

**Addressing the "Loss of Purpose"**

Now, I anticipate the counter-argument: "Without a job, people will lose their purpose."

This is a profound insult to the human spirit. It suggests that without a boss telling us what to do, we are incapable of finding meaning. Look at the open-source software movement; look at Wikipedia. These pillars of the modern world were built not for wages, but for community, prestige, and the intrinsic joy of creation.

The second speaker proposed a "Human-Centered Automation Transition." I agree, but let us be truly human-centered. A human is not a unit of economic production. A human is a creature designed for connection, curiosity, and play.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the solution to mass unemployment is not to scramble for new ways to monetize human existence. The solution is to decouple human rights from economic utility.

We must implement robust Universal Basic Services and a guaranteed income, funded by taxing the immense productivity of the AI that replaced us. We must transition from an employment-based society to a community-based society.

Let us not fear the end of the job. Let us welcome the beginning of the human.

Thank you.
