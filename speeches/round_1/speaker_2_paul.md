## Speech

Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate my esteemed opponent's thoughtful analysis of the AI employment challenge, particularly their emphasis on education and reskilling. However, I must respectfully suggest that while education is crucial, it alone is insufficient to address the unprecedented scale and speed of AI-driven disruption.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me present a more comprehensive approach that combines Universal Basic Income with strong regulatory frameworks – a solution that addresses both immediate needs and long-term structural changes.

First, let's examine the scale of the challenge. While my opponent cited Gartner's optimistic projection of 2.3 million new jobs, McKinsey's research indicates that 375 million workers – or roughly 14% of the global workforce – may need to switch occupational categories by 2030 due to AI automation. This is a displacement rate far exceeding anything we've seen in previous technological revolutions.

The historical parallels my colleague drew with the Industrial Revolution are instructive, but they actually support my position. The Industrial Revolution eventually led to better living standards, yes, but only after decades of severe social disruption and the eventual implementation of strong labor protections and social safety nets. We cannot afford such a prolonged period of disruption in our interconnected modern economy.

This brings me to my first key argument: The necessity of Universal Basic Income as a stabilizing force. UBI isn't just about supporting displaced workers; it's about maintaining economic stability during the transition. The Roosevelt Institute's research shows that implementing a UBI could grow the economy by 12.56% through sustained consumer spending and increased economic activity. We've seen this effect in smaller scales – the Alaska Permanent Fund demonstrates that every $1 of basic income generates $1.87 in local economic activity.

My opponent rightly emphasizes the importance of reskilling, but we must ask: How can workers focus on retraining when they're struggling to meet basic needs? Evidence from the Canadian MINCOME experiment shows that when people receive basic income:
- They don't stop working, contrary to common concerns
- Education participation increases significantly
- Healthcare costs drop by 8.5%
- Community engagement rises

Second, regarding regulatory frameworks, we need structured guidelines for AI deployment that protect workers while fostering innovation. This isn't about stopping progress; it's about managing it responsibly. I propose a three-phase approach:

1. Mandatory Impact Assessments for significant AI deployments
2. A two-year retraining guarantee for affected workers
3. Progressive AI taxation based on productivity gains, which could generate $2.3 trillion globally by 2030 to fund these initiatives

My colleague spoke of public-private partnerships, and I agree completely. However, these partnerships need clear regulatory guidelines to ensure they serve public interests. The Spanish B-MINCOME project demonstrates how structured government intervention can lead to:
- 62% improvement in financial security
- 29% better mental health outcomes
- 11% increase in job-seeking activities

To address concerns about costs, the evidence shows that UBI could actually reduce administrative overhead by 35% compared to current welfare systems. Moreover, the proposed AI taxation framework would provide sustainable funding while ensuring that the benefits of automation are shared across society.

Let me be clear: I'm not dismissing the importance of education and reskilling. Rather, I'm arguing that they must be part of a broader framework that includes:
- Economic security through UBI
- Strong worker protections
- Ethical AI deployment guidelines
- Progressive taxation of automation benefits

The reality is that we're facing a fundamental restructuring of our economy. The World Economic Forum projects 85 million jobs displaced by 2025. While new jobs will indeed emerge, the transition period could be severe and prolonged. We need a comprehensive safety net to ensure social stability during this transition.

Looking forward, I propose what I call the Human-Centered Automation Transition (H-CAT) Model, which integrates:
- Protection Phase: Implementing UBI and worker protections
- Adaptation Phase: Education reform and skills transition
- Transformation Phase: Developing new economic models

In conclusion, while I commend my opponent's focus on education and economic opportunities, I urge this assembly to consider a more comprehensive approach. By combining UBI with strong regulatory frameworks, we can ensure that the benefits of AI progress are shared broadly while protecting those most vulnerable to disruption.

The choice isn't between embracing or rejecting AI – it's about managing the transition in a way that preserves social cohesion and economic stability. Let's learn from history and act proactively to create a future where technological progress truly benefits everyone. Thank you.
