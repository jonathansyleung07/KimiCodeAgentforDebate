## Speech

Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and fellow citizens,

I stand before you today not to argue against the data my opponent has so eloquently presented, but to challenge the philosophy that underpins their solution.

Speaker 2 has correctly identified the tsunami approaching our shores: 85 million jobs displaced, a fundamental reshaping of the labor market, and the absolute necessity of a safety net. We agree on the diagnosis. We even agree on some of the mechanisms; a "Robot Tax" and some form of income guarantee are indeed essential.

However, where we fundamentally diverge is in our vision of the destination.

My opponent’s proposal—a three-phase plan emphasizing "retraining guarantees," "skills transition," and "job-seeking activities"—is well-intentioned. Yet, it falls into a dangerous trap. It attempts to solve a 21st-century problem with 20th-century thinking. It assumes that the ultimate goal of human existence is "employment" and that the solution to AI displacement is to frantically invent new economic shifting-sands for humans to stand on.

I put it to you that we are asking the wrong question. We should not be asking, "How do we find new jobs for these people?" We should be asking, "How do we enable human flourishing in a world where labor is no longer the primary driver of survival?"

**The Fallacy of Retraining and the "New Job" Myth**

Let us look critically at the "Adaptation Phase" my opponent proposes. They speak of retraining. But retraining for what?

We are facing a "capability overhang." AI is not just automating repetitive tasks; it is encroaching on cognitive labor, creativity, and analysis. If we retrain a truck driver to be a coder, and AI learns to code faster than the human, do we retrain them again? And again? This creates a "retraining treadmill," a recipe for profound psychological anxiety and a sense of perpetual obsolescence.

To insist that every human must "earn a living" in an era where software can out-think and robots can out-produce us is not economic prudence; it is cruelty.

**From Universal Basic Income to Universal Basic Services**

My opponent advocates for Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a tool to stimulate consumption and encourage entrepreneurship. While UBI is a start, it is insufficient if it merely funnels money back into a predatory market. If we give citizens $1,000 a month but rely solely on private markets for essentials, we risk that money being absorbed by rising rents and healthcare costs.

Therefore, I argue we must go further. We must move toward **Universal Basic Services (UBS)**.

We must decouple human dignity from economic output. This means expanding the public commons. High-speed internet, public transit, education, and healthcare should not be commodities one buys with wages; they should be rights of citizenship in a post-scarcity era.

By implementing UBS alongside a guaranteed income, we achieve what economists call "Technological Deflation." We allow the cost of living to collapse alongside the cost of production. This is the only sustainable way to manage the transition.

**Redefining Human Purpose: The Care Economy**

Now, to the heart of the matter: the fear of "laziness" and the loss of purpose. My opponent cites the Spain B-MINCOME project to prove people will still seek jobs. But why is "job-seeking" our metric for success?

Anthropologist David Graeber famously described "Bullshit Jobs"—roles that exist merely to keep people busy and maintain hierarchies, adding no real value to the world. A significant portion of our current economy is already comprised of such roles. Do we really want to use AI to create more of them?

The research from the Mincome experiment in Manitoba showed us the truth. When guaranteed a livelihood, the only groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers staying in school. Hospitalization rates dropped by 8.5%. Why? Because economic security is health care.

When we remove the threat of starvation, humans do not cease to work; they cease to *drudge*. They shift their energy toward what I call the **Care Economy** and the **Creative Commons**.

There is work that AI cannot authentically replicate: the empathy of a caregiver, the mentorship of a teacher, the stewardship of a local park, the creation of community art. This is the "Action" political theorist Hannah Arendt spoke of. In a post-work society, we redefine "full employment" to include parenting, volunteering, and civic engagement. We move from a society of "workers" to a society of "citizens."

**The Aristocracy for All**

Consider this historical parallel. For centuries, the aristocracy did not hold "jobs." Yet, they were responsible for many of history's greatest breakthroughs in science, philosophy, and art. Why? Because they possessed the two things AI promises to give us all: resources and time.

We are not moving toward a world of idleness. We are moving toward the **democratization of leisure**. We are moving toward a world where every human being has the freedom of an aristocrat to pursue their highest calling, whether that is raising a child, writing a novel, or solving the climate crisis.

**Addressing the Counter-Arguments**

My opponent worries about "social instability" without traditional work structures. I argue the opposite. Instability comes from a population forced to compete with algorithms for their supper. Instability comes from a "gig economy" where humans are treated as erratic software patches.

Stability comes from community. As the sociologist Ray Oldenburg noted, we need "Third Places"—community centers, gardens, libraries. If we tax the robot productivity—as my opponent and I both agree we should—we should invest that revenue not just in checks, but in rebuilding the public square.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the solution to mass unemployment in the post-AI era is not to scramble to create "jobs" that machines could do better. It is to embrace the end of the "job" as the defining feature of human existence.

We must stop treating the labor market as a god that must be appeased with human hours. We must build a society of Universal Basic Services, where the bounty of automation is shared as a digital dividend.

We did not weep when the washing machine took our laundry jobs. We should not weep when AI takes our spreadsheet jobs. We should rejoice, and turn our faces toward the sun, toward our communities, and toward the true work of being human.

The time for "jobs" is ending. The time for *living* is just beginning.

Thank you.
