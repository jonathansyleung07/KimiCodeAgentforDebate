Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished guests,

As we gather here today to address one of the most pressing challenges of our time – mass unemployment in the post-AI era – I stand before you to advocate for a comprehensive solution that combines Universal Basic Income (UBI) with strong regulatory frameworks. The evidence is clear: we are facing an unprecedented transformation of our labor markets that requires bold, decisive action.

Let me begin by framing the magnitude of this challenge. According to the World Economic Forum, we're looking at 85 million jobs displaced by 2025, while McKinsey projects 375 million jobs at risk by 2030. This isn't just another economic cycle – it represents a fundamental reshaping of human work.

I will present three core arguments for why a UBI-centered approach, coupled with strong regulations, offers the most effective and humane solution to this challenge.

First, UBI provides essential economic security during this massive transition. The evidence from multiple pilot programs is compelling. The Stockton SEED study showed that recipients primarily spent their basic income on essentials – 40% on food and 25% on merchandise – creating a positive multiplier effect in local economies. In fact, research shows that every dollar of UBI generates $1.87 in local economic activity, as demonstrated by the Alaska Permanent Fund. This isn't just theory – it's proven economic impact.

Second, contrary to common criticisms, UBI actually promotes work and entrepreneurship. The Canadian MINCOME experiment found only a 1% reduction in work hours among primary earners. More importantly, it enabled people to make better choices about their work and education. The Spain B-MINCOME project demonstrated an 11% increase in job-seeking activities and a 33% rise in community engagement. These findings directly counter the notion that UBI creates dependency.

Third, our proposed regulatory framework ensures a managed transition that protects workers while fostering innovation. We advocate for a three-phase approach:

1. A Protection Phase implementing UBI and worker safeguards
2. An Adaptation Phase focusing on education reform and skills transition
3. A Transformation Phase developing new economic models

To address the obvious question of cost, we have identified clear funding mechanisms. A proposed "Robot Tax" could generate $2.3 trillion globally by 2030. Furthermore, UBI actually reduces costs in other areas – administrative savings of 35% compared to current welfare systems, healthcare cost reductions of 23% in pilot areas, and a projected 2.5% GDP increase through economic stimulation.

Let me be clear about what we're proposing. Our three-phase UBI implementation plan starts with pilot programs, expands to regional implementation, and culminates in national coverage. This measured approach allows for careful evaluation and adjustment. Alongside this, we propose mandatory AI impact assessments and a comprehensive transition support system including a two-year retraining guarantee for displaced workers.

I anticipate our opponents will raise concerns about inflation and implementation challenges. However, the evidence from existing programs, such as Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend, shows no significant inflationary impact. Why? Because UBI is funded through redistribution, not money creation. As for implementation, we have detailed solutions involving biometric identification systems and blockchain-based distribution methods.

The social benefits cannot be ignored. UBI pilots have demonstrated:
- 13% improvement in mental health
- 78% reduction in poverty
- 42% reduction in crime rates
- 58% increase in community engagement

These aren't just statistics – they represent real improvements in human lives and community stability.

As we look ahead, we must acknowledge that the AI revolution differs fundamentally from previous technological transformations. The pace and scope of change are unprecedented, affecting both blue and white-collar workers across all sectors. Our response must be equally comprehensive.

I urge this assembly to consider the human cost of inaction. Without UBI and strong regulations, we risk creating a society of unprecedented inequality and social instability. The choice before us is not whether to act, but how to act most effectively.

The evidence is clear, the tools are available, and the time for action is now. Let us embrace a future where technological progress serves humanity through Universal Basic Income and thoughtful regulation. Our children's economic security and our social stability depend on the choices we make today.

Thank you.
