## Speech

*Walks confidently to the podium, acknowledging the audience with a nod*

Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, and distinguished guests,

As we gather to deliberate on the future of work in an era increasingly defined by artificial intelligence, I would like to extend my gratitude to my opponents for their thoughtful contributions to this critical discourse. Their insights on Universal Basic Income (UBI), Universal Basic Services (UBS), and the philosophical reevaluation of work deserve our respect and careful consideration.

**Acknowledge Previous Speakers**

My first opponent eloquently argued for UBI as a cornerstone for economic security, presenting compelling evidence from various pilot programs that demonstrated its potential to stimulate local economies and foster community engagement. They also emphasized the importance of a structured regulatory framework to manage this transition effectively.

My second opponent took us further, proposing a shift from income-based solutions to Universal Basic Services. They raised valid concerns about the potential pitfalls of a retraining treadmill, where workers may find themselves repeatedly displaced by rapid AI advancements. Their vision of a society liberated from the constraints of traditional employment, focusing instead on human flourishing through a "Care Economy" and "Creative Commons," offers a thought-provoking perspective.

**Address Their Arguments**

However, while both arguments provide valuable insights, they also leave critical gaps that we must address. The proposal for UBI, while innovative, presents considerable financial and implementation challenges. As evidenced by my research, history teaches us that economic growth and job creation often stem from embracing new technologies and reshaping industries through education and proactive adaptation.

The notion that we can entirely decouple human dignity from economic output overlooks the inherent value of work as a source of purpose and innovation. While UBS aims to insulate citizens from market volatility, it risks fostering dependency on state provisions without addressing the fundamental need for economic participation and contribution.

**Advance Your Position**

Allow me, then, to advance the position that embracing AI and technological change can lead to new opportunities and economic growth, provided we prioritize proactive adaptation, education, and reskilling.

1. **Economic Opportunities and AI**: As per my research, AI is set to create 2.3 million jobs by 2025, surpassing the number it will displace. This aligns with historical precedents, where technological advancements have ultimately led to net job creation. McKinsey Global Institute has projected AI could add $13 trillion to global economic output by 2030, a potential boon for job creation across new sectors.

2. **Education and Reskilling**: This is not merely a matter of preparing for specific roles; it is about fostering a culture of lifelong learning. Finland’s integration of coding into national curriculums and Singapore’s SkillsFuture initiative, which provides citizens with continuous education credits, exemplify successful frameworks for equipping the workforce for AI-related roles.

3. **Historical Success and Adaptation**: We can draw lessons from the Industrial and Digital Revolutions, where education reform and new job creation mitigated displacement. Similarly, proactive adaptation in the post-AI era will require a concerted effort to align educational outcomes with labor market needs.

**Find Common Ground**

While I advocate for proactive adaptation, I must acknowledge the merit in my opponents' emphasis on addressing immediate economic insecurity through mechanisms like UBI. Such measures, if strategically implemented, could complement a broader strategy focused on education and innovation.

Furthermore, the call for enhancing public services—integral to UBS—aligns with my vision of fostering an inclusive society where technological advancements benefit all. However, rather than replacing the need for economic participation, these services should serve as a foundation upon which individuals can build meaningful careers in emerging industries.

**Strategic Positioning**

As we move forward in this debate, let us not lose sight of the potential for AI to enhance human capabilities and expand economic opportunities. The challenge lies not in resisting technological change but in harnessing it to foster social and economic progress.

In conclusion, I urge this assembly to consider an integrated approach that emphasizes proactive adaptation through education and reskilling, supported by transitional economic security measures. This balanced strategy will ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably while preserving the dignity and purpose derived from meaningful work.

Let us envision a future where AI and human ingenuity coexist symbiotically, driving innovation and prosperity. By investing in education and embracing the opportunities AI presents, we can pave the way for a society where every individual is empowered to contribute to and thrive in the new technological landscape.

Thank you.
